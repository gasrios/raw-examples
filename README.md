# raw-examples

Three classes that show how to use [raw](https://github.com/gasrios/raw). You will need [Adobe Digital Negative Converter](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/adobe-dng-converter.html) to convert your raw images to DNG, to run all examples but `com.github.gasrios.raw.examples.ReadMetadata`.

Directory `sh` has shell scripts to run the tests.

You will need to run the following command before the shell scripts will work:

`./gradlew clean build`

## com.github.gasrios.raw.examples.ReadMetadata

Supports any TIFF based raw format.

Subclass of `com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.AbstractTiffProcessor` that displays all metadata contained in a raw file.

## com.github.gasrios.raw.examples.SavePngImage

Supports DNG.

Subclass of `com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.DngProcessor` that converts an image to PNG.

## com.github.gasrios.raw.examples.BlackAndWhite

Supports DNG.

Subclass of `com.github.gasrios.raw.Editor` that displays an image in black and white.
